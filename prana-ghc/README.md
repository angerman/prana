# prana-ghc

This package provides two things:

1. A binary `prana-ghc` that acts the same as `ghc`, but also will
   generate and install prana packages.
2. A Haskell library `prana-ghc` that can be used to compile and load
   Haskell files as prana byte code, ready for execution by
   `prana-interpreter`.
